# Chaos

We have a situation [here](http://imos.org.au/emii.html) where we would like to allow those with the necessary skills, but who may not be full-blown developers, to experiment with and make changes to our (PostgreSQL) database.

In the past, this has been done by having a shared "development" DB, with any changes made there manually "migrated" to the production DB in a very ad-hoc manner.

This is problematic for a few reasons, but mainly because changes to the production server are unmanaged, and hence, its current state is fairly chaotic.


# Control

Ideally, we want people to have the ability to do their (development) work *using the tools that they are already familiar with*, but at the same time, provide an easy and well managed path to get their changes from development to production.


# Controlled Chaos

I am going to propose a workflow which I believe can give us *control* while still maintaining a (good) level of *chaos!*

You will need:

* a unixy OS, e.g. linux or OS X
* [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [vagrant-berkshelf plugin](https://github.com/riotgames/vagrant-berkshelf)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/)

So let's clone the [associated github project](https://github.com/jkburges/emii_toolkit.git) and fire up vagrant:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jkburges/emii_toolkit.git
$ cd emii_toolkit/
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
[default] Importing base box 'ubuntu-12.04-omnibus-chef'...
.

.
[2013-09-18T05:48:26+00:00] INFO: Chef Run complete in 454.580271656 seconds
[2013-09-18T05:48:26+00:00] INFO: Running report handlers
[2013-09-18T05:48:26+00:00] INFO: Report handlers complete
$
```

Success (I hope)!

The code (and the VM) is all there for you to take a look at if you're interested, so I am not going to go in to *how* this all works.  Instead, let's go straight to anâ€¦

# Example Workflow

Let's say one of my colleagues would like to add a new table to the database, using his or her tool of choice, [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/).  Here's how to do it:


1. Create a connection to the database residing within the VM (noting that the port is **15432** and password is **postgres**):<br/>
![new database connection](/assets/controlled_chaos/new_connection.png)<br/><br/>
2. Create the new table under **localhost VM/geoserver/public/tables**:<br/>
![new database connection](/assets/controlled_chaos/new_table.png)<br/><br/>

3. Run the diff script:<br/>
```$ bin/diffChangeLog.sh great_new_table```

The way I've set this up is to have a [*different* git project](https://github.com/jkburges/emii_db) for the DB migrations (to keep them separate from all the vagrant/environment infrastructure).  However, it lives within our current hierarchy, and we can go there to see what changes have been made to *that* repo:

```
$ cd workspace/emii_db/
$ git status
#
#	modified:   changelog.xml
#
# Untracked files:
#
#	great_new_table.changelog.xml
```

Examining the contents of `great_new_table.changelog.xml`, we see that our changes made in PgAdmin have been turned in to "code":

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<databaseChangeLog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-2.0.xsd">
    <changeSet author="vagrant (generated)" id="1379486681518-1">
        <dropTable tableName="great_new_table"/>
    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```

The great thing about this is that it allows us to now manage this like any other source code: version control it, have it reviewed by others, but best of all, apply it to a production DB in a controlled (and repeatable) fashion.

# Summary

I really haven't gone in to much detail about how this is all actually implemented.  Really what I want people to take out of this post is that it's possible to have a process which allows people (who are not necessarily developers by trade) to get their changes in to a production database, but in a controlled manner.

Comments, as well as pull requests to the associated github project, are welcome!
